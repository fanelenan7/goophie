# Goophie!

Check out deployed project at [http://another-giphy-clone.surge.sh/](http://another-giphy-clone.surge.sh/).

This project, using GIPHY API, was made as a code challenge for [WireWheel](https://www.wirewheel.io/). I had a lot of fun making this, and while I know that using Vue.js was preferred, I can achieve much better result using React.

I hope you like using this little app!
